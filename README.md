# CMD_primer_designer
PCR primer designer for the Chimeric Minimotif Decoy Assay from 2014

This is an interactive perl script from 2014, intended for use with the Chimeric Minimotif Decoy Assay. It takes a list of amino acid sequences (as a FASTA file), a restriction enzyme selection (from a multiple choice list), and a choice of amino acid locations within the sequences to mutate to alanine (for controls). It then outputs PCR primer sequences for each of the sequences in the input file (without flanking machine-dependent adapters).
